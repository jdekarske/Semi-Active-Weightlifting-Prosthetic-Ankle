# README #
This repo contains any modeling, trials, and code related to SAWPA currently at BME 400.
Others are most likely interested in motive file handling.
### Brief ###
* Start by downloading the [C3D server](https://www.c3dserver.com/).
* I've included sample C3D's and functions.
* I used a custom markerset: big-toe distal joint, malleoli, lower tibia, tibial tubercal, asymmetrical center tibia.
* `AdamsquatV2.m` should be commented enough to follow. If not I'd be happy to walk you through it.
